# protoc-gen-elmer

A protoc code generator that produces decoders, encoders and RPC clients for Elm. Written in Go.

Under heavy / active development. Speak to @Joshua on Slack if needed.

## Motivation
- Elm decoders and encoders are a pain:
    - Easy to write,
    - usually long and repetitive,
    - subtleties like nullable leads to accidental footguns,
    - writing them is simply not valuable:
        - just take time
        - usually when you least want to e.g. making changes elsewhere, head full of ideas of your actual problem
- RPC clients
    - we have to define a protocol: a form of client <> server
    - the semantics of communicating with an external service are known
        - message passing to TEA
    - so ultimately: trigger (probably init) -> cmd -> ... -> msg
    - Also a boring problem
- Server side
    - Not unique to Elm, this pain is everywhere
    - unless you have the same language on front and back plus a transport
    - This sucks too!
- backwards / future compatability
    - dealing with change
    - remarkably little opinion on how to deal with this, I just want instruction

Why now? There's a good protobuf library that deals with the wire format. A couple of codegen projects but they're not feature complete and don't go far as they could. For example, well-known type support is missing and no RPC clients. This is in part because the PB browser support is poor. I think this is a missed opportunity for Elm and missing puzzle piece.

In summary: let's minimise this problem and not think about it ever again.

### What for real
- Types without borders
    - Specify an API
    - Clients use the API, servers implement it
    - and watch codegen / well-established libraries propagate from this
- Protobuf
    - IDL
    - Lots of codegen, probably covering your language (now including Elm!)
    - Specifies compatability layer and how to deal with change
    - they've thought about it! They have an answer! They have opinions on it!
- Elm has a good base protobuf codec library
    - It's binary (presumably faster),
    - it's feature complete / stays true to Protobuf
- Provide answers and clear guidelines for server-side support.

Bring all this together and write a client-side generator for:
    - codecs
    - RPC
    - tests
    - minimal, simple server side

### Examples

Showcase the ease and value-add. Given a Protobuf example:

```
show example of small Protobuf: message+enum with a few values
```

Translate it for the reader.
- messages = records
- enum = sum type
- show example Elm output

Example of RPC:

```
show Twirp hat service example
```

Again, translate: service / rpc -> elm interface

This section is TODO. For now, check the examples folder. Also see ##Development testing.

### counter-what
- RPC moves away from REST which existing tooling is focussed on. It limits observability.
- Protobufs have _opinions_. It borrows a lot from Go's semantics. Notably Go's codegen results sometimes look out of place; e.g. naming with underscores.

### So counter-what
- Codecs are the /real/ value add. Get rid of your boilerplate!
- Don't use RPC if you don't want to or it doesn't add much for you.

### Trade-offs, downsides, and limitations

- Protobuf enums are open, Elm wants them to be closed. Fundamental to Protobuf's opinions on API extensibility.

- Protobuf oneofs may be nil.

- Ident mapping: _this section is no longer valid as naming changes_
    - Compared to Go's codegen, the name mapper is more complex but is closer to what you'd write naturally in Elm.
    - Proto makes nested namespaces easier. This can make choosing how to build Elm names harder difficult which, in comparison, is flat. When flattening you may end up with name collisions which then get suffixed with a `_` in Elm. Name collisions should be avoided at all costs as they make reading the Elm code difficult and ambiguous.
        - Ideally you would avoid nesting in your `.proto` and the resulting codegen looks natural.
        - Try `qualify=t` first to qualify your identifiers.
        - Try `separator=_` next to replace proto ns dots with underscores.
        - If you get _any_ name collisions or this isn't possible then the next best thing is to make it look more obvious that you're dealing with an external namespace. Set `collision=_` and naming collisions get suffixed with an underscore. This should resolve all naming collisions. If not: BUG!
        - Finally, for the ultimate in avoiding naming collisions change the separator to a unicode character that looks like a dot. For example `ê“¸` https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+A4F8 You'll then have a one-to-one mapping on IDs. This is a crazy idea and best avoided.
    - Enum options are expected to be short with a high potential of overlapping names. So these are suffixed with their enum type by default. TODO option is `variant_suffix`

## Installing

TODO provide GitHub binary download to $PATH

For now, see ##Development

### Using `protoc-gen-elmer`

These commands output to `examples/`.

The following generates code for our example.proto:

```
protoc --elmer_out=examples --elmer_opt="" examples/example.proto
protoc --elm-fuzzer_out=examples --elm-fuzzer_opt="" examples/example.proto
protoc --elm-twirp_out=examples --elm-twirp_opt="" examples/example.proto
```

TODO comment on how to organise .proto. Best practices, etc

### Options

Valid `--elmer_opt`. Please see `cmd/protoc-gen-elmer/flags` or run with `-h`

TODO expand this section with options and commentary on each option

## Server-side

- Describe why PB on the server is a natural fit.
    - For Go, kind of looks like a HTTP handler anyway: `handler(ctx, inputs) (output, error)` where inputs is a mapping from req. Difficult to reduce this.
    - Great for inter-server comms (hopefully you don't have this issue)
- Mention pitfalls
    - transcoding brings caveats, the absolute behemouths known as gRPC+envoy
    - no streaming
- Twirp is just a simple answer. buf/connect is a candidate. would like streams which would probably involved websockets (this is an idea for future work).

Provide examples. Add hat making service to `examples/` to show end-to-end usage as a template / starting point. This aim is the holy grail of this library!

## Development notes

You don't need to read this section to use `protoc-gen-elmer`. Steps to set up a development environment:
- Install https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/ (note just the compiler, we're explicitly avoiding GRPC)
- Install Go (1.16 min)
- Install `elm`, `elm-format` and `elm-test`
- Put `bin/` in your $PATH and see ##installing
- Run `go generate ./...` (for tests)

Tests can then be run with: `go test ./...` Most test cases specify a Protobuf file, run it through codec and fuzzer codegen, `elm-format` and finally `elm-test`. If you run an individual test case you can see the code generated in `pkg/elmgen/testdata/gen-elm/src/`

Build the `protoc-gen-elmer` binaries:
```
go build -o bin/protoc-gen-elmer cmd/protoc-gen-elmer/main.go
go build -o bin/protoc-gen-elm-fuzzer cmd/protoc-gen-elm-fuzzer/main.go
go build -o bin/protoc-gen-elm-twirp cmd/protoc-gen-elm-twirp/main.go
```

An approximate, high-level view: `.proto` (stdin) -> `protogen` (PB library used by cmd/) -> `elmgen` (core pkg in this repo) -> `gen_*.go` -> `*.elm` (stdout).

We rely on `protocolbuffers/protobuf-go` to read Protobuf. The `protogen` pkg provides helper structs to translate to Go code. So the heart of this library is `elmgen` that has a similar goal in organising ingested PBs to be consumed by Elm codegen tools. The types are specified in `elmgen.go` and the entry point is `module.go`. It's goal is to always produce valid Elm code. You'll also find the code generators in this folder as they're coupled to the internal elmgen.

You'll find `printgen` is just a simple, dumb way to dump the structures of `protogen` to better understand inputs. It aided initial development.

Finally we also have `cmdgen`. A small pkg that holds common options and helpers for the `protoc-gen-elm*` commands.

### TODO
This is my dev scratchpad of ideas and in-progress notes.

Major goals to complete:
- Well-known types: Any, Timestamp, Duration, Wrappers, etc
- Protobuf comment passthru
- 64-bit support
- Existing options have caveats (e.g., partial feature support). Avoid this.
- Twirp client options (URL prefix, auth, etc)

Smaller steps:
- proto2 syntax
- limited enums for when we really don't care about compat control?
- comments with Elm naming commands? e.g., [elm=HelloEnum]
- enums with allow_alias=true prefixes alias function
- imports need to reference other files
- unknown types result in a panic
- change do not edit line to match: ^// Code generated .* DO NOT EDIT\.$
- reserved names (enums) should be registered so collisions end up with _
- variants are suffixed but Go codegen prefixes. Presumably because it's closer to proto's ns

code quality:
- naming has two paths, it over complicates elmgen
- elmgen/Field is overloaded, needs to be an interface

release checklist
- Review README
- examples folder

## Bugs, other

For now, talk to @Joshua on Slack

## Naming

I've aimed for a fully designed naming system assuming full control over client, API and server in the aim to avoid naming collisions. However this doesn't take into account future change eg., Elm could add reserved words. At that point the API shouldn't be revised beyond the Protobuf rules
